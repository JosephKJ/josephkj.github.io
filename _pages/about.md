[//]: # (I am a <a href="https://research.adobe.com/person/joseph-k-j/">Research Scientist</a> at <a href="https://research.adobe.com/">Adobe</a>. )

I am a <a href='publications'>computer vision researcher</a>. Most of my explorations draws inspiration from the ingenuity of human brain. Its ability to improve itself with experiences, quantify what it does not know, and its natural instinct to be creative guides my research in  multi-modal learning, continual learning, open-world learning, class-discovery and generative modeling with deep neural networks. 

I obtained my PhD and Master's degree from <a href="https://iith.ac.in/">IIT Hyderabad</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://people.iith.ac.in/vineethnb/">Prof. Vineeth N Balasubramanian</a>.
