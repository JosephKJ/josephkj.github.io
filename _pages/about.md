I am a PhD student at IIT Hyderabad.
I am fortunate to have <a href="https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/index.html" target="_blank"> Dr. Vineeth N Balasubramanian</a>, as my advisor.
I work on building machine learning models that can learn incrementally, just like humans do.
I am also interested in generative modelling, learning under weak supervision and vision problems like detection and segmentation.

Before joining IIT Hyderabad, I was working at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/index.html" target="_blank">Oracle</a>, as a Senior Software Engineer for 3.5 years.
I used to develop softwares for PeopleSoft PeopleTools Platforms team.
