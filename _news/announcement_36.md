Design-o-meter, an approach to evaluate and refine design documents is accepted to WACV 2025 (round 1, acceptance rate 12.1%). Kudos to my brilliant undergraduate interns: [Sahil Goyal](https://sahilg06.github.io/) (IIT Roorkee) and [Abhinav Mahajan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhinav-mahajan-727068233/) (IIIT Bangalore).
